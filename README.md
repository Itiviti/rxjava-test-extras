# rxjava-test-extras
This library provides some handy testing utilities for RxJava.

## Maven/Gradle

You can add this library as a dependency to your Maven or Gradle project through [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#Ullink/rxjava-test-extras).

## Features

For now the only available feature is a "Demo Scheduler" which works like a threadsafe TestScheduler from RxJava.
